Lingo Privacy Policy

We take privacy extremely seriously here at Lingo.
We don't track, we don't profile.
Lingo does not run through a server, nor does the app require you to login.
We don't check your vaccination status, your preferred pronouns, or whether you like to hoard toilet paper.
The Lingo app does not store any personal information whatsoever, nor does it need to transfer information data over the internet.  The only links to the internet are done through the Google Play Store and the App Store.
All app functionality is stored locally on your device...just the way it should be.
